       <h2> Information about this website </h2> 
        
        <p>  Hello and welcome to my page!! Here you will find lots of javascript and information about my involvement in URI and Computer Science. In this course, I aim to do my very best to accomplish everything. This website shows the progress and skills I will establish through coding. As I work on my javascript projects, I expand my coding skills. Even though coding is not my prime, I will do whatever I can to make it easy and fun. In the future, I will use coding to create new ideas and new products that will satisfy the customers. If I wanted to code a video game, it would be Minecraft. If you would like to know about me, you can navigate to the <a href="https://jaco-coder8.github.io/about.html"><b>about me</b></a> tab. If you want to see my coding skills, then feel free to access the  <a href="https://jaco-coder8.github.io/javascripts.html"><b>javascript</b></a> tab. By pressing the <a href="https://jaco-coder8.github.io/index.html"><b>home tab</b></a>, you will go to the home page. As my high school, CS teacher always said, <em>"Happy coding!!"</em></p>
