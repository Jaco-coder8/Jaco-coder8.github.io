            <h2> Information about me </h2>
              
              <p>Hello, my name is Jacob Pimentel. I come from the western part of Coventry, Rhode Island. Being a student in college means a lot to me because my mother quit college and went back in her 30s to graduate. My father never got a chance to go to college. His educational status lasted till high school. During my college experience, I want to show my parents and family that I can graduate college with good grades and a good college experience. On my first week of college classes, I was stressed out and hopeless. I did not reach out to any teachers because I didn't know how to use the websites needed to reach out. After all the hassle and stress, I am making a website using coding. Wow, that's awesome! I can't wait to see what happens during my first year of college. Nothing is easy if you don't reach out for help ad assistance. As I always say, "Practice makes progress."</p>
